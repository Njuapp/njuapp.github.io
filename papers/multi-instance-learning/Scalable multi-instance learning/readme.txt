	                   Readme for the miVLAD and miFV algorithms package
								version Jan. 16, 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package includes the MATLAB code of the multi-instance learning algorithm miVLAD and miFV.

For miVLAD (miFV), you can use the "miVLAD" ("miFV") function to perform both training and testing process.

You will find five benchmark MIL data sets in these packages. The fold of 10CV are also provided.
